## **__An Overview of Racket__**

Racket is a general purpose programming language derived from Lisp. It is referred to as a "programmable programming language" 
because its built-in macro system is so powerful that it allows a programmer to redefine everything about the language itself.
For this reason, Racket is often used to design and implement custom programming languages for specific project needs.

Racket was originally developed as part of the PLT ("Programming Language Team") project by computer scientist Matthias Felleisen in the 1995.
His intention was to create a language which would help novice programmers learn more about the potential of computers.


## **_Hello world Example_**

**Hello world Program**

```Racket

; This is comment it starts wit a semi colon 

#lang racket/base
"Hello, World!"

```
## **_How to Run_**
To run the labs or problems sheets just copy my repositry and download the DrRackket IDE from the link below......
- https://download.racket-lang.org/

After you installed follow these steps 

1. Down on bottom of IDE select Language i am using RACKET. 
2. than open file where you downloaded the repo to . 
3. Run the project 


## **_Functional Programming_**
here is a link to a bit of Functional Programming

## **_DrRacket IDE_**
DrRacket (formerly DrScheme) is widely used among introductory Computer Science courses that teach Scheme or Racket and is lauded for its simplicity
and appeal to beginner programmers. The IDE was originally built for use with the TeachScheme! project (now ProgramByDesign), an outreach effort 
Northeastern University and a number of affiliated universities for attracting high school students to computer science courses at the college level.

The editor provides source highlighting for syntax and run-time errors, parenthesis matching, a debugger and an algebraic stepper.
Its student-friendly features include support for multiple "language levels" (Beginning Student, Intermediate Student and so on).
It also has integrated library support, and sophisticated analysis tools for advanced programmers.
In addition, module-oriented programming is supported with the module browser, a contour view, integrated testing and coverage measurements, and refactoring support.
It provides integrated, context-sensitive access to an extensive hyper-linked help system named "Help Desk".

DrRacket is available for Windows (95 and up), Mac OS X, Unix, and Linux with the X Window System and programs behave similarly on all these platforms.
